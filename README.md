This is a demonstration project made by the team of Android developers from Jelvix.

We used Nasa open API in this project: https://api.nasa.gov/index.html. 
Come explore with NASA and discover the latest images and videos with the app.

Here is the list of features:
- View the astronomical picture of the day. Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.
- Access to over 160,000 images.
- Watch over 3,000 NASA videos from around the agency.
- Search feature with continuous pagination.
- Save your own favorite medias to local database and get quick access to them.

During the development we used MVP architecture with Moxy, Retrofit, Dagger 2, RxJava.
